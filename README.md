# TinyThings
A tiny template web application for connecting with RERUM. You will see all
CRUD actions proxied through RERUM in the TinyThings back-end. Feel free to fork
this as a starting point for creating your own application that uses the RERUM service.

Visit [rerum.io](http://rerum.io) for more general information about RERUM. See a working demo of this application at [tiny.rerum.io](http://tiny.rerum.io/app).

Want to use the API in your web application? Learn how at the [API page](https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/rerum_server/blob/master/API.md).


## Who is to blame?
The developers at the Walter J. Ong, <sub><sup>S.J.</sup></sub> Center for Digital Humanities authored and maintain this template
in connection with the RERUM service.
Neither specific warranty or rights are associated with RERUM; registering and contributing implies only those rights 
each object asserts about itself. We welcome sister instances of RERUM, ports to other languages, package managers, builds, etc.
